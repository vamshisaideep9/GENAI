Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\\r\\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\\r\\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\\r\\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\\r\\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\\r\\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\\r\\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\\r\\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\\r\\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\\r\\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\\r\\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\\r\\nDiana: Thank you. What's your current budget?\\r\\nTom: We were thinking about £400 000. Would it be possible?\\r\\nDiana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?\\r\\nTom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.\\r\\nDiana: How much are you aiming for?\\r\\nTom: At least £300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.\\r\\nDiana: Could you please send me some pictures? I would also gladly make an appointment with you.\\r\\nTom: That would be perfect!\\r\\nDiana: Would Monday at 8 be acceptable?\\r\\nTom: Hm, I need to consult it with my wife, but so far it's all right.\",\n",

But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.\\r\\nTarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. \\r\\nQuentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.\\r\\nTarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?\\r\\nQuentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.\\r\\nTarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?\\r\\nQuentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.\\r\\nTarquin: But it\\'s really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.\\r\\nQuentin: Yes, that\\'s probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.\\r\\nTarquin: Yes. That\\'s from Peter\\'s company right?\\r\\nQuentin: indeed.

Once you are there, head for Wildboardclough, it's signposted, and you are soon on the map.\\r\\nLiz: Well it still sounds complicated but we'll give it a try. Do you think we may ask for directions in the pub?\\r\\nLaurien in Buxton: By all means! Just mention Oldhagsboards to the publican and he'll give you precise directions.
